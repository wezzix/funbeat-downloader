# Funbeat Downloader
This .NET program allows you to export your full and complete training data and day notes from your Funbeat account at funbeat.se

The main motivation is to extract information which is not included in the regular Funbeat export xls file, particularly Ascent and Descent. But all data is there if you need it.

Data is available as json and in grid form to be further processed in Excel, Google Spreadsheet or other spreadsheet application.

Build in a rush with little error handling. Pull requests are welcome if you want to contribute.
